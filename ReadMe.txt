This repository is only used to achieve the exercise from OpenClassRooms[dot]com lesson about the use of git & gitHub.
It holds nothing more than what's required in this exercise, which means :
- a "readme.txt" file (this one)
- 2 more files of any type
- 4 differents commits with clear comments

It's useless to say that this is not a colaborative work ;)
